## Project Goal

The Game of Thrones Memory Game has been created to give Game of Thrones or memory game enthusiasts the opportunity to have fun while finding the matching cards, though it is suitable for all age groups. As an added bonus, this game can also improve some brain functions such as attention, concentration and focus. In addition to developing one's visual recognition and short-term memory, it can also enhance a person's long-term memory, too, as per [Curious World](https://www.curiousworld.com/blog/importance-playing-memory-games).

This project is for educational purposes only and has been created for the Interactive Front-end Development module of Code Institute.

## User Experience (UX)

* ### User stories
    * #### User Goals

        1. I want to easily navigate the site, play again, or exit the game if I choose to, with one click.
        1. I want to understand the rules of the game.
        1. I want a game that is simple to play.
        1. I want to check my scores and my time so that I can compete with myself.
        1. I want the website to work well on tablet and mobile as I choose to play games while on the go or commuting.

* ### Design
    * #### Color Scheme
        The gloomy and cold colors of the Night's Watch have inspired me to use the below color palette which I made via [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).
        &nbsp;
        ![Color palette](./assets/tests/color-palette.png)
        &nbsp;
        According [Color Psychology](https://coschedule.com/blog/color-psychology-marketing#blue) blue is associated with trust, dependability which are in line with a lot of the themes detectable in Game of Thrones. Whereas [white](https://coschedule.com/blog/color-psychology-marketing#white) or whiter shades of blue usually create a sense of purity, peace and cleanliness. Whereas [black](https://coschedule.com/blog/color-psychology-marketing#black) conveys seriousness, control, independence but it can carry mystery or death, which are also recurring elements in the series.
        &nbsp;
        The color contrast checker gave very good ratings for using #091B2A as a background color while using #D7EDF3 as the text color.
        &nbsp;
        ![Contrast checker one](./assets/tests/contrast-checker-one.png) I intended to use this combination for the main page, pop-ups and instructions. 
        &nbsp;
        I also liked the effect of using #BACFEO on buttons and juxaposing it with #081D3A when used as text color or on the footer.
        &nbsp;

    * ### Typography
        According to [Shmoop](https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/game-of-thrones-book/themes), there is a mixture of classic and contemporary themes characterising Game of Thrones, such as power, gender, betrayal, family, society and class, principles, coming of age, justice and judgement, memory and the past, strength and skill. I wanted my fonts to reflect this dichotomy so I decided to go with [Cinzel](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cinzel?preview.text=Winter%20is%20coming&preview.text_type=custom#glyphs) which resembles roman inscriptions, but also has a contemporary feel to it. I used [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat#glyphs) for instructions and as the fallback font.
       
    * ### Structure
        
* ### Wireframes

    I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/docs/) when creating the wireframes for my website.
