## Project Goal

The Game of Thrones Memory Game has been created to give Game of Thrones or memory game enthusiasts the opportunity to have fun while finding the matching cards, though it is suitable for all age groups. As an added bonus, this game can also improve some brain functions such as attention, concentration and focus. In addition to developing one's visual recognition and short-term memory, it can also enhance a person's long-term memory, too.

## User Experience (UX)

* ### User stories
    * #### User Goals

        1. I want to easily navigate the site, play again, or exit the game if I choose to, with one click.
        1. I want to understand the rules of the game.
        1. I want a game that is simple to play.
        1. I want to check my scores and my time so that I can compete with myself.
        1. I want the website to work well on tablet and mobile as I choose to play games while on the go or commuting.

    * #### Color Scheme
        My color palette was inspired by

        * 
    * ### Typography
        According to [Shmoop](https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/game-of-thrones-book/themes), there is a mixture of classic and contemporary themes characterising Game of Thrones, such as power, gender, betrayal, family, society and class, principles, coming of age, justice and judgement, memory and the past, strength and skill. I wanted my fonts to reflect this dichotomy so I decided to go with [Cinzel](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cinzel?preview.text=Winter%20is%20coming&preview.text_type=custom#glyphs) which resembles roman inscriptions, but also has a contemporary feel to it. I used [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat#glyphs) for instructions and as the fallback font.
